The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It uses the [.NET Core CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/) to compile and execute your project.

## Useful commands

* `dotnet new lambda.EmptyFunction --name MyFunction` creates a new empty lambda function
* `dotnet build src`                                  compile this app
* `cdk deploy`                                        deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`                                          compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`                                         emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
